# Lung Cancer Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

Lung cancer remains as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and high smoking rate heavily impacts Indonesia. One of the challenges to combat lung cancer is the difficulties in early detection, due to the subtleness of the symptoms in early stages. So, another approach was proposed by using machine learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the detection and classification of the presence of lung cancer cells from Computerized Tomography scan (CT scan) images. The study focused on three types of lung cancer which are adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma (LCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The authors utilized Kaggle's chest CT scan dataset to train and evaluate models based on ResNet-50, ResNet-50V2,and MobileNetV2 architectures. These models were chosen due to their proven effectiveness in image recognition. The result indicates that CNN can effectively differentiate between normal and cancerous lung tissue.


## Lessons Learned

Learned to utilize AI/ML frameworks such as TensorFlow to use pre-trained models. Implementation of different pre-trained models, which are ResNet-50, ResNet-50V2 and MobileNetV2 model, served as image recognition for the CT-scan images. Each model produced different results, the first model ResNet-50 having the lowest results with an accuracy of 50.79%. ResNet-50V2 and MobileNetV2, as the second and third model, have an accuracy of 80.87% and 86.28% respectively, which proves to be an improvement in the development of a lung ancer detection model.

Comparison was done between the 3 models, therefore there is still a high possibility that with other CNN models like ensemble model or efficientNet, the accuracy can be increased and the loss can be minimized.
